                <p>For most of recorded history, women and other marginalized groups have been operating under a system of oppression, which has stifled their ability to express their own skills, pursue individual goals, and subjugated their very existence to lower-ranking humans. This form of oppression has metastasized into various aspects of social thinking, creating stereotypes and resulting in stereotype threat, a situational predicament in which people who are exposed to a certain negative stereotype end up conforming to that stereotype, becoming anxious and underperforming.</p> 

                  <p>As a result, the last 20 years revealed a 64 percent decline in women interested in pursuing computer science degrees in the US (likely related to the lack of women in leadership positions at universities). In 2011, the Huffington Post also reported a decline in African Americans pursuing STEM degrees. Not only are STEM companies ignoring minority talent, the culture is actively discouraging these diverse groups from pursuing careers in this quickly growing and ever-crucial industry.</p>
