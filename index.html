              <h3>Tech Inclusion</h3>
              <p>Build the pipline, as minorities we are the pipeline. It's time to be included we must inject ourselves
                into this industry.

              <h3>Youth Involvement</h3>
              <p>The next generation will be extremely immersed in tech. We have to teach them young. Educating them on how they are learning a 
                skill that will forever be in demand. Critical thinking and peer learning are very important in developmental skills.
